# Reposit
A simple personal code snippet repository that allows a user to create and group code snippets used to solve specific problems so that snippets can be easily found for reuse or review in the future.

This product seeks to provide a virtual repository that allows users to create and categorize code snippets deemed helpful. This facilitates keeping track of important and helpful solutions to small problems frequently encountered. For example, a user may want to remember an effective method to process an array of integers and removed all multiples of a given input, n.

The project comprises the RepositAPI and the Reposit Web Application, which are "standalaone" services hosted separately, though the Reposit Web Application makes calls to the RepositAPI.
